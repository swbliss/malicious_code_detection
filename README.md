# Malicious Code Detection
This project is about malicious javascript code detection by utilizing Convolutional Nueral Network.
As malicious code leverages meaningless characters in codes, I adopt character-level CNN of Yann Lecun.

## Built With
* [Python3.5](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.5/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
